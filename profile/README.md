# Welcome

'Comistry' group works in the computational exploration of molecules and the discovery of innovative drugs. We merge the rich, century-long knowledge of chemistry with the prowess of Computational Chemistry, Computational Structural Biology, and Machine Learning.

## Research Projects
### Computer-assisted and Computer-driven Drug Discovery
We combine Molecular Docking (Docking) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) to study drug-like molecules, proteins, and protein-ligand complexes.
- Explore how metabolites from medicinal herbs and plants interact with protein targets with high druggability.
- Explore how DNA polymerase discriminate nucleotides and correct the mismatched ones when replicating DNA. This molecular level of understanding is essential in exploring the working mechanism of DNA- or RNA-replicating associated drugs such as Remdesivir which was authorized for emergency use to treat COVIDâ€‘19 in numerous countries. In collaboration with the Simmerling Lab at Stony Brook University.
- Develop prediction tools for targeted covalent inhibitors. This is an emerging class of drugs that covalently binds to a protein, as compared to mostly Van der Waals interaction in most small molecule drugs. The computational methods involve Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, machine learning, and Docking. In collaboration with the Forli Lab at The Scripps Research Institute.

### Exploring Molecules and Reactions with Quantum Chemistry and Machine Learning
We utilize the robust DFT to compute electronic structures of a molecule and its associated thermodynamics and kinetics properties such as changes in enthalpies and Gibb free energies, activation energies, and transition state structures. We also harness machine learning models, which predict properties based on historical data rather than physical laws, from traditional ones like Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to sophisticated ones like Transformer.
- Explore and predict properties of the adducts of Lewis bases (LB) and Lewis acids (LA). This is a classic yet exciting non-conventional chemical bond. In collaboration with Prof. Emily Jarvis at Loyola Marymount University.
- Study mechanisms of organic reactions:
  - DFT calculations to study Gibb free energy changes associated with a green condensation reaction catalyzed by Zn-based metal-organic-framework nanocrystals. In collaboration with Gachon University.
  - DFT for kinetics and stereochemistry of a Diels-Alder reaction using green bio-sourced reactants
